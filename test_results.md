## 4. Recommendations

*   **EC-LM-001:**
    *   Implement input validation to limit the length of `firstName`, `lastName`, and `travelPreferences` fields. Consider truncating the input and saving it or returning an error message to the user.
*   **EC-LM-002:**
    *   Optimize the lead import process to handle large CSV files efficiently.
    *   Implement pagination or batch processing to avoid memory issues.
    *   Increase the maximum execution time limit.
    *   Consider using a background job to process the import asynchronously.
*   **EC-CC-001:**
    *   Implement input validation to limit the length of the SMS body. Consider truncating the input and saving it or returning an error message to the user.
*   **ST-XXS-001:**
    *   Implement input sanitization to remove or encode potentially malicious characters from user input.
    *   Implement output encoding to prevent the browser from interpreting user input as code.
*   **Performance Tests:**
    *   Acquire and configure performance testing tools (e.g., JMeter, Locust) to execute the performance test cases.
    *   Establish performance baselines and set acceptable response time thresholds.

## 5. Test Coverage Improvement

*   **Performance Testing:** Implement performance tests to ensure the application can handle expected load and maintain acceptable response times.
*   **Security Testing:** Expand security testing to cover other potential vulnerabilities, such as authentication and authorization flaws, session management issues, and data leakage.
*   **Negative Testing:** Add more negative test cases to cover invalid input, unexpected user behavior, and error handling.
*   **API Testing:** Develop dedicated API tests to ensure the API endpoints function correctly and securely.
*   **UI Testing:** Expand UI testing to cover all user interface elements and interactions.  Automated UI testing will greatly improve test coverage and speed up regression testing.
