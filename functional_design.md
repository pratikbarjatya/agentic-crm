### 1.3. System Overview

The Travel Agent CRM is a web-based application designed to manage the entire customer lifecycle, from initial lead generation to ongoing customer relationship management. It provides tools for:

*   **Lead Management:** Capturing, segmenting, and scoring leads.
*   **Communication Management:** Sending targeted emails and SMS messages, and tracking all communication.
*   **Customer Conversion:** Converting leads into customers and managing customer profiles.
*   **Booking Management:** Associating bookings with customer profiles and tracking travel arrangements.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:** Providing insights into lead conversion rates, customer behavior, and agent performance.
*   **Administration:** Managing users, roles, data backups, and system configuration.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture Diagram (Description)

The system adopts a three-tier architecture:

1.  **Presentation Tier (Client):**  This tier comprises the user interface (web browser) through which travel agents, sales managers, customer service representatives, and administrators interact with the system. It handles user input, displays data, and communicates with the application tier.

2.  **Application Tier (Server):** This tier contains the core business logic of the CRM. It processes user requests, interacts with the data tier, and implements the system's functionalities, such as lead management, communication management, and reporting. This tier will include microservices for specific functionalities such as SMS sending, email sending, lead scoring, etc.

3.  **Data Tier (Database):** This tier stores the system's data, including lead information, customer profiles, booking details, and user accounts. A relational database management system (RDBMS) like PostgreSQL is recommended for its reliability and scalability.

The communication between tiers is primarily through RESTful APIs.

### 2.2. Component Breakdown

The system consists of the following key components:

*   **Lead Management Component:** Handles lead creation, import, segmentation, and scoring.
*   **Communication Management Component:** Manages email and SMS communication, including integration with email providers and SMS gateways.
*   **Customer Management Component:** Manages customer profiles, booking information, and customer service interactions.
*   **Reporting and Analytics Component:** Generates reports on lead conversion rates, customer behavior, and agent performance.
*   **User Management Component:** Handles user authentication, authorization, and role management.
*   **Booking Integration Component:** Integrates with external booking systems (e.g., GDS, Amadeus) to retrieve booking information.
*   **Workflow Automation Component:** Automates tasks such as sending follow-up emails or assigning leads to agents.
*   **Agentic Suggestion Engine:** Suggests next best actions and communications based on lead/customer data and pre-defined rules.

### 2.3. Data Flow

1.  **User Interaction:** A user interacts with the presentation tier (web browser) to perform an action, such as creating a new lead or sending an email.

2.  **API Request:** The presentation tier sends an API request to the application tier.

3.  **Business Logic:** The application tier processes the request, applying relevant business logic and interacting with other components as needed (e.g., the lead scoring component).

4.  **Data Access:** The application tier accesses the data tier (database) to retrieve or update data.

5.  **Response:** The data tier returns the requested data to the application tier.

6.  **API Response:** The application tier formats the data and sends an API response back to the presentation tier.

7.  **Display:** The presentation tier displays the data to the user.
