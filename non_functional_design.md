# Non-Functional Requirements Document: Agentic CRM Application

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the Agentic CRM application, a Travel Agent CRM system designed to manage leads, communication, customer relationships, and sales performance. These NFRs define the quality attributes of the system and are crucial for its successful implementation and operation. They complement the functional requirements defined in the user stories.

**2. Performance Requirements**

*   **2.1 Response Time Expectations:**

    *   **General Page Load Time:**  All page load times should be under **3 seconds** for users with a reasonable internet connection (minimum 10 Mbps).  Pages with complex data visualizations or large datasets may take up to **5 seconds**, but should provide visual feedback (e.g., loading spinner).
    *   **Data Entry/Submission:** Data entry and form submissions (e.g., creating a new lead, updating customer information) should be processed and confirmed within **2 seconds**.
    *   **Search Queries:** Simple search queries (e.g., searching by name or email) should return results within **1 second**. Complex search queries (e.g., searching by multiple criteria) should return results within **3 seconds**.
    *   **Report Generation:** Generation of standard reports (e.g., lead conversion rates) should complete within **5 seconds**.  More complex, custom reports may take up to **10 seconds**, but should provide visual feedback and the option to run asynchronously.
    *   **API Response Times:** External API calls (e.g., SMS gateway, email provider) should have a maximum response time of **2 seconds**.  Error handling should be in place to gracefully manage API timeouts.

*   **2.2 Throughput Requirements:**

    *   **Concurrent Users:** The system should support a minimum of **100 concurrent users** during peak hours without significant performance degradation.
    *   **Lead Creation:** The system should be able to handle at least **1000 new leads per hour** during peak marketing campaigns.
    *   **Email Sending:** The system should be able to send at least **5000 emails per hour** through automated email campaigns.
    *   **Data Import:** The system should be able to import a CSV file containing **10,000 leads in under 5 minutes**.

*   **2.3 Scalability Considerations:**

    *   **Vertical Scalability:** The application should be designed to allow for vertical scaling (increasing resources of existing servers) to handle increased load.
    *   **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture should be designed to support horizontal scaling (adding more servers to the system) for increased capacity and redundancy.  Consider a microservices architecture or message queue for asynchronous task processing.
    *   **Database Scalability:**  The database should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of leads, customers, bookings, and historical data.  Consider using a cloud-based database service that offers automatic scaling.
    *   **Future Growth:** The system should be designed to accommodate a 50% increase in users, data volume, and transaction volume within the next two years.

**3. Security Requirements**

*   **3.1 Authentication and Authorization:**

    *   **Authentication:**
        *   **Secure Password Storage:** Passwords must be stored using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with a unique salt for each password.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Support for MFA should be implemented to enhance security.  Options include SMS-based OTP, authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator), or email verification.
        *   **Password Complexity Requirements:** Enforce strong password complexity requirements (minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
        *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout after a specified number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
        *   **Session Management:**  Use secure session management techniques (e.g., HTTPOnly cookies, session timeout).

    *   **Authorization:**
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control user access to different features and data based on their role (e.g., Travel Agent, Sales Manager, CRM Administrator).  Refer to US-017 for user role management.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their job functions.
        *   **Data Access Control:**  Implement granular data access control to restrict access to sensitive data based on user role and permissions.

*   **3.2 Data Protection:**

    *   **Data Encryption:**
        *   **Data at Rest:**  Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database and file storage using AES-256 or a similar encryption algorithm.
        *   **Data in Transit:**  Use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all communication between the client and server to encrypt data in transit.
    *   **Data Masking:**  Mask sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, personal identification numbers) in reports and logs to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Implement regular data backups (refer to Reliability and Availability section) to protect against data loss.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web vulnerabilities.
